										<h4>The moment you know you love a place.</h4>

											There is a time when, as you reflect on your past, you will find yourself forever grateful for it.
											The years I've spent in Delft hold a special place in my heart. It might be a bit strange but true, 
											this place has a way to make you feel right at home. I can't help but wonder, does this serve as an evidence 
											that a place or a country can be universally cherished, transcending borders and cultures? Yet, there's more to it - the wonderful 
											souls I've encountered here. Moments with them are like a sweet melody. 
											My senses seem to awaken in their presence, a sentiment I hold dear.
											<br />
											<br />
											When it comes to a question -  what do you think about life? Leo-the-handsome, 
											and Cynthia-the-optimistic both share a desire to stay in the Netherlands and in search of a life rich in meaning 
											and tranquility. Then there's Zoey-the-poetic, contemplating a journey across the vast expanse of Oceania. 
											Sometimes I get a tad sentimental about this, for my friends hold a special place in my heart. 
											Over the past two years, the bonds we've woven have evolved into connections that feel destined to last a lifetime. 
											They make the days shine with an iridescent glow. Later today, I said to Leo, that someday in the not-so-distant future, 
											we'd go on journeys together, and our weekends would be marked by joyful dinners in the company of friends. Oh, that would be nice. 
											Moments spent with friends are eternally touching, gentle, and etched in the book of unforgettable memories.
											<br />

											<br />
											As I strolled by the beautifully illuminated buildings at TU Delft, it dawned on me just how much I enjoy the lively atmosphere, 
											especially at night. There's something truly delightful about working on projects and diving into research with like-minded folks, 
											and it's even better when your friends are right there with you. You can see the warmth of our friendship shining through. 
											<br />
											<br />
											This is why I love Geomatics so much. I treasure my time here, I hold my friends close to my heart, and I'm deeply grateful for the mentors 
											who've guided me along the way. These experiences have left an indelible mark on my heart, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

											Later that night, I took a walk with Zoey. She was on her way to the library to work
											on her project. During our stroll, we talked about our experiences and feelings here and I 
											had the chance to hear her story and her dreams for the future. Studying Geomatics has
											been an incredible journey, especially if you're passionate about it. It's not just about gaining
											knowledge and exploring technologies. What I truly love, deep down in my heart, is getting obssessed with something meaningful. Zoey feels the same way. 
											At times, projects can become quite intricate, and progress may seem elusive. However, Zoey said: 'I know eventually I can figure it out'. Her eyes radiate 
											both wisdom and an unwavering enthusiasm for the Geomatics field. We both hope that this enthusiasm can endure as time goes by. 
											-->
											<br />
											<br />
											I've noticed that many of us in Geomatics share this passion, including my mentor and friend, Ken. 
											They have introduced me to a lifestyle I wholeheartedly embrace and love, 
											which is why I hold deep affection for them. Sometimes, it feels like I'm living in a dream or on a distant planet. 
											Perhaps a bit of self-exile has always been a part of my soul. It is akin to walking alone in a desert, and then 
											Geomatics embraced me and gave me a sense of belonging. We walk this path together, 
											experiencing the blossoming flowers of life along the way.
											<br />
											<br />
											I guess this is why I love Geomatics.
											<br />
											<br />
											<h4>Seasons of the Soul</h4>
											Today, I attended an exercise course with a colleague. 
											For the first time in my role as a research assistant, 
											I found myself answering questions from students. 
											The experience was quite extraordinary and felt almost surreal. 
											In those moments, I was more than just myself; 
											I felt connected to my mentors at TU Delft. I vividly recall how, 
											two years ago, I was the one inquiring eagerly, 
											and my mentors always responded with patience and insight. 
											Their wisdom is something I cannot thank them enough for. 
											It seems to me like a form of "inheritance" - in whatever I do, I try to uphold their standards and attitude.
											This, I believe, may very well be the essence of "education".

											And perhaps, it also offers a glimpse into the true nature of friendship, where whatever you are doing,
											you find yourself reminded of someone's virtues.

											<h4>Words of Wisdom.</h4>
											<em>"Side projects are always a good idea, I think indeed work sometimes doesn't go as you expect, 
												and you can get energy from these things and from what you like in your personal life."

											<em>"I am really happy to see Geomatics touching the hearts of students. 
												Witnessing studentss falling in love with their pathes is aspirational also for me. Honestly, at the beginning or even now 
												from time-to-time I sometimes finding myself in the thoughts that am I the right person to teach, I sometimes feel that 
												I am belonging to the engineering world rather than to academy. But when I see such messages or in my conversations with students, 
												when students find something we do somehow helpful, I become more inspired and happy about maybe indeed I can touch some students 
												hearts and make them love what I love to do via teaching. Maybe it is the path?"

											<em>"I understand, (big) change is always sentimental. You wonder whether it's a good decision, whether maybe it won't be the same, 
												or maybe you won't like it at all. But you never know these things, 
												and usually, it turns out to be quite good and you'll enjoy it. Maybe not in the same way, but you'll find a way to make it good for you!"

											<em>"Yesterday, my teammate asked me: 'What kind of status
												do you aspire to, what kind of person do you envision
												becoming, and what kind of work do you hope to be doing?'
												<br />
												I feel that ... it appears as though ideal, at least for the present moment."
												<p style="text-align: right;"><a>

											</em>
											<em>"I perceive it this way: during one's youth,
												it's entirely acceptable to explore extensively,
												perhaps even venture across the world in which
												you reside. Nonetheless, when one day you no longer
												find it feasible to continue this journey, you come to realize
												that it is time to get back home."

											<em>"Attitude precedes skill."

											</em>
											<em>"Sometimes, it’s a valuable part of the journey to explore paths that turn out not to be the right fit. I hope you don’t feel too disheartened by this experience. Instead, I hope it helps guide you toward something that truly suits you—something where you feel confident and can radiate the kind of energy that draws the right people and opportunities to you. I also hope you’ll rediscover the spark you had when you chose to pursue a program abroad. That same person is still within you, full of strength and potential."
