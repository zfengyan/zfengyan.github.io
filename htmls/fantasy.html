										<h4>The moment you know you love a place.</h4>

											There is a time when, as you reflect on your past, you will find yourself forever grateful for it.
											The years I've spent in Delft hold a special place in my heart. It might be a bit strange but true, 
											this place has a way to make you feel right at home. I can't help but wonder, does this serve as an evidence 
											that a place or a country can be universally cherished, transcending borders and cultures? Yet, there's more to it - the wonderful 
											souls I've encountered here. Moments with them are like a sweet melody. 
											My senses seem to awaken in their presence, a sentiment I hold dear.
											<br />
											<br />
											When it comes to a question -  what do you think about life? Leo-the-handsome, 
											and Cynthia-the-optimistic both share a desire to stay in the Netherlands and in search of a life rich in meaning 
											and tranquility. Then there's Zoey-the-poetic, contemplating a journey across the vast expanse of Oceania. 
											Sometimes I get a tad sentimental about this, for my friends hold a special place in my heart. 
											Over the past two years, the bonds we've woven have evolved into connections that feel destined to last a lifetime. 
											They make the days shine with an iridescent glow. Later today, I said to Leo, that someday in the not-so-distant future, 
											we'd go on journeys together, and our weekends would be marked by joyful dinners in the company of friends. Oh, that would be nice. 
											Moments spent with friends are eternally touching, gentle, and etched in the book of unforgettable memories.
											<br />

											<br />
											As I strolled by the beautifully illuminated buildings at TU Delft, it dawned on me just how much I enjoy the lively atmosphere, 
											especially at night. There's something truly delightful about working on projects and diving into research with like-minded folks, 
											and it's even better when your friends are right there with you. You can see the warmth of our friendship shining through. 
											<br />
											<br />
											This is why I love Geomatics so much. I treasure my time here, I hold my friends close to my heart, and I'm deeply grateful for the mentors 
											who've guided me along the way. These experiences have left an indelible mark on my heart, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
