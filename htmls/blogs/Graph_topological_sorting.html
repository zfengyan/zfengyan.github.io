									</header>
									<p>
										In graph theory, topological sorting, often referred to as topological ordering, is primarily 
										employed to determine the sequence of nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
										In a DAG, vertices have interdependencies due to the existance of directed edges. 
										For instance, given two vertices U and V, a directed edge (U, V) implies that V 
										can be reached from U, while the reverse is not true - U cannot be reached from V. 
										In this context, V is regarded to have a dependency on U. 
										The topological order is essentially a linear arrangement of all the vertices within a DAG. 
										It provides a systematic depiction of feasible sequences originating from certain vertices 
										and concluding at others. <br />
										
										<br />
										Now let's delve into some fundamental yet crucial concepts regarding a DAG:
										<ol>
											<li>A DAG contains at least one vertex with the indegree zero.</li>
											<li>A DAG contains at least one vertex with the outdegree zero.</li>
										</ol>

										These two characteristics are derived from the term "acyclic" - signifying the absence of loops 
										within the DAG. Consequently, there is always at least one origin vertex and one ending vertex. 
										It's important to note that a DAG can comprise multiple disconnected components, 
										meaning that there can be separate subgraphs within the graph that are not directly connected 
										to each other. Each of these components is still a DAG, as long as they satisfy the two 
										properties mentioned above.

										<br />
										<br />

										Let us see an example:

										<br />
										<img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort.png" alt="alternatetext" style="width:600px;height:300px"><br />
										
										<br />
										Directed edges: <i>{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}</i>

										<br />
										"in" represents "indegree"

										<br />
										<b>Order of removal</b>: <i>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</i>

										<br />
										<b>A possible topological order</b>: <i>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</i>

										<br />
										Note that the sequence is not the only possible topological order. 
										For instance, <i>0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5</i> is also a valid topological order.
										
										<br />
										The process of Kahn's algorithm:

										<div class="image-grid">
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_1.png" alt="Step 1">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 1: remove node 0 (with indegree = 0) and its outward edges.
												Update the indegree of the deleted edges’ destination nodes (1 and 2).
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_2.png" alt="Step 2">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 2: remove node 1 and 2, alongside the outward edges. 
												Update the indegree of node 3 and 4. 
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
										      <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_3.png" alt="Step 3">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 3: remove node 3 and its outward edges. 
												Update the indegree of node 4 and 5.
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_4.png" alt="Step 4">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 4: remove node 4 and 5.</p>
											</div>
										</div>

										Now, with these considerations in mind, let's delve into the implementation details.
										To begin, we will need to summarize specific steps in order to write pseudocode
										and then proceed with the actual implementation.

										<br />

										Given a DAG, denoted as G and represented with an adjacency list, the algorithm can be 
										summarized as follows:

										<ul>
											<li>Calculate the indegree for all nodes in G.</li>
											<li>Identify a node with an indegree of 0, indicating no incoming edges.</li>
											<li>Remove the identified node from G and add it to the topological ordering.</li>
											<li>Remove the outgoing edges from the removed node in G.</li>
											<li>Decrement the indegree of the connected destination nodes (those connected by the edges removed in the previous step).</li>
											<li>Repeat these steps until no nodes are left with zero indegree, signifying that either
												all nodes have been traversed or a cycle has been encountered.
										</ul>

										After completing these steps, check if all elements are present in the sorted order. If this is the case, a valid topological ordering has been obtained. Otherwise, no topological ordering is possible.



					
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// pseudo code for an example
	
queue to store faces; // for BFS
add starting face to the queue;

while (queue is not empty)
{
	currentFace = queue.front();
	if (current face has not been processed yet) { // if not yet been processed, process it
		process it;
		mark it as processed;
	}
	queue.pop(); // pop the current face from the queue

	// Add all possible finite neighbours - not crossing constrained edges and not yet processed
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
		neighborFace = currentFace->neighbor(i);
		if (neighborFace is a finite face) { // only add finite neighbors
			commonEdge = common edge of (currentFace, neighborFace);
			if (commonEdge is not constrained && neighborFace has not been processed yet) {
				add the neighborFace to the queue
			}
		}
	} // end for: all neighbors (including infinite neighbors)
}
