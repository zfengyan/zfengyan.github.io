										<h3>How to store a graph with customized nodes?</h3>
										<h5>Special thanks to: <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" class="custom-link">
											ChatGPT</a>
										
										</h5>
									</header>
									<p>
										A graph, usually can be conceptually described and represented with ease, alongside a straightforward
										illustration. When an algorithm is explained, the audience can see quite a good elaboration with a drawing
										of a graph. A graph typically consists of two parts: (1) the node in the graph and (2) the relationships between
										the nodes. In the blog: <a href="../blogs/Graph_topological_sorting.html" class="custom-link"> 
											Kahn’s Algorithm for Topological Sorting</a> we simplified the modelling and implementation of a graph,
										as the graph nodes are directly represented by integers, allowing them to be used as indices of an array. Based
										on that, the relationships among them (a.k.a edges) can also be easily implemented. However, in many scenarios, a node
										can have certain properies, such as its degree, or for instance we would like to also store
										its incident nodes. Therefore, how should we represent these customized nodes, and to represent
										the whole graph?
										<br />									
										<br />
										Implementation-wise, we will use C++ as our preferred language to demonstrate how it can be done.
										The core logic is to store a customized (or user-defined) node, which can be easily achieved by creating
										a class, and also store the relationships with its incident nodes in the graph. This can be realized
										by utilizing a dictionary (<code class="custom-code">std::unordered_map</code> and <code class="custom-code">std::map</code> in C++), having the node as key and the list
										of its incident nodes as values:
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
struct Node{
	// data and methods
};
std::unordered_map&lt;Node, std::list&lt;Node&gt;&gt; adjacencyLists;
</code></pre>
										We similarly create an adjacencyLists, and each element contains a node and a list conataining
										all of its incident nodes. It seems to be pretty simple, yet if you try to compile it, you will 
										possibly get compile errors:
<pre><code class="language-console">
error: call to implicitly-deleted default constructor of 'std::hash<Node>': _Hash() {}
note: default constructor of 'hash<Node>' is implicitly deleted because base class '__enum_hash<Node>' has a deleted default constructor 
struct _LIBCPP_TEMPLATE_VIS hash : public __enum_hash<_Tp>
note: '__enum_hash' has been explicitly marked deleted here __enum_hash() = delete;
error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'integral_constant<bool, false>::value': the specified hash does not meet the Hash requirements
static_assert(__check_hash_requirements<_Key, _Hash>::value,
</code></pre>



										Now let's delve into some fundamental yet crucial concepts regarding a DAG:
										<ol>
											<li>A DAG contains at least one vertex with the indegree zero.</li>
											<li>A DAG contains at least one vertex with the outdegree zero.</li>
										</ol>

										These two characteristics are derived from the term "acyclic" - signifying the absence of loops 
										within the DAG. Consequently, there is always at least one origin vertex and one ending vertex. 
										It's important to note that a DAG can comprise multiple disconnected components, 
										meaning that there can be separate subgraphs within the graph that are not directly connected 
										to each other. Each of these components is still a DAG, as long as they satisfy the two 
										properties mentioned above.

										<br />
										<br />

										Let us see an example:

										<br />
										<img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort.png" alt="alternatetext" style="width:600px;height:300px"><br />
										
										<br />
										Directed edges: <i>{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}</i>

										<br />
										"in" represents "indegree"

										<br />
										<b>Order of removal</b>: <i>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</i>

										<br />
										<b>A possible topological order</b>: <i>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</i>

										<br />
										Note that the sequence is not the only possible topological order. 
										For instance, <i>0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5</i> is also a valid topological order.
										
										<br />
										The process of Kahn's algorithm:

										<div class="image-grid">
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_1.png" alt="Step 1">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 1: remove node 0 (with indegree = 0) and its outward edges.
												Update the indegree of the deleted edges’ destination nodes (1 and 2).
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_2.png" alt="Step 2">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 2: remove node 1 and 2, alongside the outward edges. 
												Update the indegree of node 3 and 4. 
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
										      <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_3.png" alt="Step 3">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 3: remove node 3 and its outward edges. 
												Update the indegree of node 4 and 5.
											  </p>
											</div>
											<div class="image-container">
											  <img src="../../images/blogs/Graph_top_sort_4.png" alt="Step 4">
											  <p class="image-title">Step 4: remove node 4 and 5.</p>
											</div>
										</div>

										Now, with these considerations in mind, let's delve into the implementation details.
										To begin, we will need to summarize specific steps in order to write pseudocode
										and then proceed with the actual implementation.

										<br />

										Given a DAG, denoted as G and represented with an adjacency list, the algorithm can be 
										summarized as follows:

										<ul>
											<li>Calculate the indegree for all nodes in G.</li>
											<li>Identify a node with an indegree of 0, indicating no incoming edges.</li>
											<li>Remove the identified node from G and add it to the topological ordering.</li>
											<li>Remove the outgoing edges from the removed node in G.</li>
											<li>Decrement the indegree of the connected destination nodes (those connected by the edges removed in the previous step).</li>
											<li>Repeat these steps until no nodes are left with zero indegree, signifying that either
												all nodes have been traversed or a cycle has been encountered.
										</ul>

										After completing these steps, check if all elements are present in the sorted order. If this is the case, a valid topological ordering has been obtained. Otherwise, no topological ordering is possible.



					
<pre><code class="language-cpp"> <!-- <pre></pre> is used for preformatted where the original format is crucial (formatting exactly as entered) -->
// pseudo code for an example

Kahn_topological_sort(Graph G)
{	
	For each node in G{
		Find and populate indegree[node]; // get the indegree for all the nodes in G
	}

	Create a stack or queue; // auxiliary data structure - as a container

	Add nodes with indegree 0 to the queue;

	while(node U with indegree 0 exists in the queue){
		Remove U from the queue;
		Remove all its outgoing edges (U, Vi) from G;

		For destination vertices Vi which had their incoming edges removed{
			indegree[Vi] -= 1;
		}

		Add new nodes with indegree 0 to the queue;
	}

	// determine if a topological ordering has been found
	if(elements sorted = all elements)
		return true or print nodes in topologically sorted order;
	else 
		return false or prompt that no topological ordering exists (e.g. there exists rings in G)

}
</code></pre>
										<br />
										Now let's implement it using C++, the very first thing is to design a data structure to store a graph.
										<br />
										For the purpose of simplfying the code, we might as well consider representing the graph nodes using integers, numbering from 0 to a specific value. 
										
										We can then use these integers as array indices. 
										Consider the following example:
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
node_array[0] = {1, 2};
</code></pre>
										In this representation, it signifies that there are two directed edges: <i>0 -> 1, 0 -> 2</i>
										<br />
										To store our graph, we can make use of a 2D array, often referred to as an <i>adjacencyList</i>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; adjacencyList;
</code></pre>
										
										As illustrated above, each element in the adjacencyList contains a 1D array, 
										representing the destination nodes connected by directed edges originating from 
										the current node. For instance, <code class="custom-code">adjacencyList[0]</code> 
										represents a 1D array containing the nodes incident to node 0.
										<br />
										The overall code is as follows:
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;queue&gt;
using std::vector;
using std::queue;
		
// Graph class - store the input graph
		
class Graph{
public:
	Graph(int NumberOfNodes) : m_numberofNodes(NumberOfNodes){
		m_adjacencyList.resize(NumberOfNodes);
		m_inDegree.resize(NumberOfNodes, 0);	    
	}
			
	void add_directed_edges(int src, int dest){
		m_adjacencyList[src].emplace_back(dest);
	}

	// main function: topological sort
	bool topological_sort(vector&lt;int&gt;& sorted)
	{
	    auto indegree_copy = m_inDegree; // save a copy of the indegree vector
	    
	    // store all the nodes with no incoming edges
	    queue<int> nodes_with_zero_indegree;
	    for(int i = 0; i < m_numberofNodes; ++i)
	    {
	        if(m_inDegree[i] == 0)nodes_with_zero_indegree.push(i);
	    }
	    
	    // process - while the queue is not empty
	    while(!nodes_with_zero_indegree.empty())
	    {
	        auto current_zero_node = nodes_with_zero_indegree.front();
	        nodes_with_zero_indegree.pop(); // delete the node with zero indegree
	        sorted.emplace_back(current_zero_node); // add it to the sorted list
	        
	        // alter the graph: delete the incident edges and update the indegree
	        // of the incident nodes connected to current_zero_node
	        for(auto const& dest_node : m_adjacencyList[current_zero_node])
	        {
	            // delete the directed edge: current_zero_node -> dest_node
	            // meaning the indegree of the dest node decrements by 1
	            --m_inDegree[dest_node];
	            
	            // if the updated indegree of dest node is now zero
	            // add it to the nodes_with_zero_indegree queue
	            if(m_inDegree[dest_node] == 0) nodes_with_zero_indegree.push(dest_node);
	        } // end for
	        
	    } // end while: while the queue is not empty
	    
	    // a cycle was encountered - if the sorting is done but not all input nodes have been sorted
	    if((int)sorted.size() != m_numberofNodes)return false;
	    
	    // successfully sorted
	    return true; 
	    
	}
